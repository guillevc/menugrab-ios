# Menugrab

Menugrab is an application that allows users to order food from a restaurant table with their phone. It also makes possible to order remotely and pick it up when it's ready.

It features a list of restaurants and menus that users can choose from.

The app is also available through an [App Clip](https://developer.apple.com/app-clips/), which makes possible to scan a table identifier provided by the restaurant (e.g. an NFC tag)  and start making an order without the need of installing the app.

# iOS App

This repository contains the source code of the iPhone app component of the application.

The app is built completely using SwiftUI and Combine, reducing to almost zero the use of callbacks and delegates.
